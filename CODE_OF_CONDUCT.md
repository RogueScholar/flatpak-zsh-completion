# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering a productive and respectful environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to keep a watchful eye out for trolls and assorted other misanthropes who will attempt to sour our mood with poorly described bugs and an outrageous sense of entitlement to our time and skill. No time will be wasted in educating them about the dimly-lit, biological suggestion box they were given by their maker perfect for the filing of their useless issue reports and pet feature requests.

Making good software is important, but making good developers is **_critical_** to the establishment of our utopian meritocracy on an island yet to be determined, which is why we will tell you when you do or say something abjectly stupid, with as much tact and discretion as our sleep-deficit financed lifestyles permit, of course. You would do well to take our rebukes seriously when they arrive for as much as we want to contribute substantively to your personal growth, we're even more determined not to become anyone's babysitters out of a futile attempt to prioritize the avoidance of hurt feelings over writing good code.

Participation in our project and community should be a harassment-free experience for everyone, but most especially for us at the top who have been here since Moses was in short pants. We reserve the right to be be both self-serving and capricious from time to time and if you don't like it, we refer you to the above mentioned dimly-lit suggestion box. We wish we were kidding. You'll understand if you ever spend the time needed in the swivel chair to get to where we are, for at that point you too will find that sanity runs through your fingers like so many grains of sand.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Sucking up, without shame, to those in positions of seniority (we especially love fresh donuts and little tchotckes for our desks)
* A deep and abiding acceptance of the fact that opinions are like assholes: everyone has one and they all stink
* Dealing with problems that only concern you without involving us
* The careful planning and execution of elaborate pranks and practical jokes on our mutual acquaintances so we can remember how it feels to have a good belly laugh
* Keeping any news of positive developments in your life to yourself; we're on the far side of that hopeful place young people occupy with their whole lives ahead of them. All we want to do is write a few more lines of good code and desperately forget that moment last week when we changed our parents' adult diaper and thought to ourselves that life will be good again when someone starts performing that service for us.[1]

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at bilelmoussaoui@gmail.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

[1]: If you have soft hands, and generous spirit and a strong stomach, we encourage you to apply for the position. If we hire you and finally retire then part of the very generous compensation package is the ability to look out, as we do, on the pitiful assortment of FOSS projects we've gotten stuck maintaining for the handful of remaining users they each have and know that it's all yours to do with as you please.
